Step 1 : PrerequisitesBefore you begin, make sure you have the following installed: Python (3.8 or later) For text generation, you can use popular language models like GPT-2, GPT-3, or any other model that suits your needs. Ensure you have the model and its dependencies installed. 123pip install transformers==4.35pip install torch==2.1.1pip install gradio==4.4.1 Step 2: Create a Text Generation FunctionWrite a Python function that takes a prompt as input and generates text using the pre-trained language model. Here‚Äôs a simple example using the GPT-2 model from the transformers library: 123456789101112131415161718import torchimport transformersimport gradio as grfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, GPT2Tokenizermodel_name = &quot;gpt2&quot;model = AutoModelForCasualLM.from_pretrained(model_name)tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)if tokenizer.pad_token_id is None: tokenizer.pad_token_id = tokenizer.eos_token_iddef generate_text(prompt): inputs = tokenizer([prompt], return_tensors=&quot;pt&quot;) output = model.generate(inputs, max_length=100, do_sample= True, top_k=50, top_p=0.95) generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True) return generated_text Step 3: Create a Gradio InterfaceNow, create a Gradio interface for your text generation function. Define an interface with an input text box for the prompt and an output text box to display the generated text. 123demo = gr.Interface(fn=generate_text, inputs=&quot;text&quot;, outputs=&quot;text&quot;)demo.launch(server_name=&quot;0.0.0.0&quot;, server_port=7861) Step 4: Run Your Gradio AppSave the script and run it. Gradio will launch a local web interface @ localhost:7861 for your text generation app. With this command you can auto-reload the browser when you make changes to your app. Open your web browser and navigate to the provided URL to interact with the app. 1gradio app.py Step 5 : Interact with Your Text Generation AppEnter a prompt in the input text box and see the generated text in the output text box. Experiment with different prompts to observe how the model responds. This how your first look of app will be Step 6 : (Pro Tip) Lets add some good looks to this AppWe can start with adding the description. So lets do that. We can also add more input to our app to have more control over our output. Update your Interface class with the following changes 1234567891011121314description = &quot;&quot;&quot;# Deploy your first ML app using Gradio&quot;&quot;&quot;inputs = [ gr.Textbox(label=&quot;Prompt text&quot;), gr.Textbox(label=&quot;max-lenth generation&quot;, value=100), gr.Slider(0.0, 1.0, label=&quot;top-p value&quot;, value=0.95), gr.Textbox(label=&quot;top-k&quot;, value=50,),]outputs = [gr.Textbox(label=&quot;Generated Text&quot;)]demo = gr.Interface(fn=generate_text, inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs, allow_flagging=False, description=description)demo.launch(server_name=&quot;0.0.0.0&quot;, server_port=7861) Step 7 : (Pro Tip) Animated text generationAlso text generation is taking time so it will be good if we can show the text word by word right. Lets do that by using some thread and TextIteratorStreamer class. Now update the generate_text method with following changes: 123456789101112131415161718192021from threading import Threadfrom transformers import TextIteratorStreamerstreamer = TextIteratorStreamer(tokenizer, timeout=10.0, skip_prompt=True, skip_special_tokens = True)def generate_text(prompt, max_length, top_p, top_k): inputs = tokenizer([prompt], return_tensors=&quot;pt&quot;) generate_kwargs = dict( inputs, max_length=int(max_length),top_p=float(top_p), do_sample=True, top_k=int(top_k), streamer=streamer ) t = Thread(target=model.generate, kwargs=generate_kwargs) t.start() generated_text=[] for text in streamer: generated_text.append(text) yield &quot;&quot;.join(generated_text) ConclusionCongratulations! You have created a simple Gradio app for text generation. You can further customize the interface, explore different pre-trained models, and enhance the user experience. Gradio simplifies the process of creating interactive machine learning applications, making it easy for users to interact with your models.","link":"/2023/11/29/technical/Text-Generation-with-Gradio/"},{"title":"Exporting an ONNX Model from TensorFlow","text":"To export a TensorFlow model to the ONNX format, you can use the TensorFlow-ONNX converter.
